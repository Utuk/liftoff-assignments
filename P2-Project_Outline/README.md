# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. 
In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry 
if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview

My project will be a parental control app. It will allow the user to build a database of playlists of videos and music 
to then send wirelessly to another device as a form of parental control and ease. The user will able to create
an account and only the main account holder will be able to log in as a parent or a child, link the app to other 
devices, create and delete playlists, add and remove items from the playlists, switch the playlist being viewed 
and control the start, stop and pause functions of the playlists.


The idea for this project came when my family took a cross country trip. My children are very young, 1 and 3. 
In order to keep them entertained in the car they each had a tablet. They are too young to control their tablets well so I 
mounted them on the inside of the car. Netflix allows you to pre-download movies and shows to play without any internet connection
but once the specific show ends, it forces the user to select another downloaded title in order to keep playing. Nothing 
automatically plays on Netflix and Netflix doesn't have the option for the account user to build a playlist of downloaded 
items to allow for seamless playing of many videos. As such I would have to unbelt while my husband was driving and become a 
master yogi in order to reach the tablet and select another program to play. So instead I thought it would be much easier 
to have the main app on my phone (with internet connection through my phone) which can build a playlist and control the play functions and stream it via Bluetooth 
to my kids tablets.

### Features
<ul>
    <li>User Sign up: Users will be able to create their own account, allowing them to build their own approved playlists
     for their children to watch  </li>
    <li>User Login: Only the main account holder will able to login as either a parent or child once the account is created. The passwords will be 
    hashed and salted. </li>

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am new to building apps specifically for mobile devices so Kotlin, Android Studio and Material Design will all be new 
to me. I have worked with databases on some previous assignments but only those that stored static information so I will 
have to research more into databases storing video/music files to see if that alters anything. I am also not sure if I 
will be needing to use Spring Mobile or Spring Android for this application, this is another unfinalized area that needs 
further research. Bluetooth technology is also a new area for me so I will need to study Android Studio and Spring 
tutorials to finalize proper implementation. I will also have to learn how to connect everything through Android Studio.
